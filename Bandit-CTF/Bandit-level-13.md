# Bandit Level 13 â†’ Level 14

## What I Had to Do  
This level gave me a private SSH key which could be used to log into the next level.

---

## How I Solved It  
Logged in using:

```bash
ssh bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Password used:
```

```

I then copied the private key to `/tmp/mykey`, gave it the right permissions:

```bash
chmod 600 mykey
ssh -i mykey bandit14@localhost -p 2220
```
