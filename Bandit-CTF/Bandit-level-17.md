# Bandit Level 17 â†’ Level 18

## What I Had to Do  
In this level, I had to create a file named **`~/passwords/new_password`** containing the current password, and set the permissions so that **only the owner can read and write**.

```

Password used:

Commands used:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/passwords
echo cGWpMaKXVwDUNgPAVJbWYuGHVn9zl3j8 > ~/passwords/new_password
chmod 600 ~/passwords/new_password
```

After that, the system automatically validated the challenge.
