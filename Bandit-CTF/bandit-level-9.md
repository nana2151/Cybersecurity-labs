# Bandit Level 9 â†’ Level 10

## What I Had to Do  
The file in this level was a **hex dump**. I needed to convert it back to raw text and extract the password.

## How I Solved It  
Logged in using:

```bash
ssh bandit9@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

Password used:

```

Used `xxd` and `strings`:

```bash
xxd -r data.txt decoded.txt
strings decoded.txt
```

## What I Learned
